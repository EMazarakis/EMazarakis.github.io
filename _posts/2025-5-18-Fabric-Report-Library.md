## Introduction
Often in Fabric, you need to locate a specific report or item (such as a notebook) but can't remember which workspace it's in. 
This typically means going through each workspace one by one to find it. Now, you can use a Power BI report that lets you search directly and quickly identify the workspace containing the item youâ€™re looking for. Alternatively, you can query the related table stored in the Lakehouse.
