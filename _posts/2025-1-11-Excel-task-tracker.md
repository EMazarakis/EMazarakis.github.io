## Introduction
A task list proves its value by enabling you to plan, delegate, and monitor every aspect of a project’s work. It also serves as a handy tool to keep stakeholders and team members informed with quick progress updates.

With our free Excel task template, staying on top of your tasks has never been easier—whether you're managing a critical project or tackling a key assignment. We've handled the heavy lifting so you can enjoy the satisfaction of checking off completed tasks.

## Excel Tracker Template
The template contains 2 sheets:
1. TaskTracker
2. Settings

The **TaskTracker** sheet serves as the GUI of the template.
The **Settings** sheet contains all relevant lists for the dropdown cells and also holds the dataset for the bar chart.
The date picker is an add-in from the store, named Mini Calendar and Date Picker.
Conditional formatting is applied to the Status and Priority values.

### Chart Analysis
Additionally, a bar chart is included to give a clear visual breakdown of tasks by status, making it easier to assess overall project progress at a glance. Whether tasks are categorized as "Not Started," "In Progress," or "Completed," the bar chart provides a quick, intuitive way to track progress and identify areas that need attention. This added visual element ensures better communication and helps your team stay aligned on priorities.

### Eisenhower Matrix/Analysis
This tool helps you divide your tasks into four categories: the tasks you'll do first, the tasks you'll schedule for later, the tasks you'll delegate, and the tasks you'll delete.
**How to prioritize in Eisenhower**
1. *Do Now*:   Important=Yes & Urgent=Yes
2. *Schedule*: Important=Yes & Urgent=No
3. *Delegate*: Important=No  & Urgent=Yes
4. *Delete*:   Important=No  & Urgent=No

When you select the "Important" or "Urgent" checkboxes, each task is automatically added to the corresponding section: "Do Now," "Schedule," "Delegate," or "Delete."
